/*
Explanation:
When a condition for an if statement is true, the block of code following it is executed. What about when that condition is false? Normally nothing would happen. With an else statement, an alternate block of code can be executed.

if (num > 10) {
  return "Bigger than 10";
} else {
  return "10 or Less";
}

Exercise:
Combine the if statements into a single if/else statement.

Tests:
Waiting:You should only have one if statement in the editor
Waiting:You should use an else statement
Waiting:testElse(4) should return the string 5 or Smaller
Waiting:testElse(5) should return the string 5 or Smaller
Waiting:testElse(6) should return the string Bigger than 5
Waiting:testElse(10) should return the string Bigger than 5
Waiting:You should not change the code above or below the specified comments.

function testElse(val) {
  let result = "";
  // Only change code below this line

  if (val > 5) {
    result = "Bigger than 5";
  }

  if (val <= 5) {
    result = "5 or Smaller";
  }

  // Only change code above this line
  return result;
}

testElse(4);
*/
function testElse(val) {
  let result = "";
  if (val > 5)
    result = "Bigger than 5";
  else 
    result = "5 or Smaller";
}

testElse(7);
