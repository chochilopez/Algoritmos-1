/*
Explanation:
You can also nest arrays within other arrays, like below:

const teams = [["Bulls", 23], ["White Sox", 45]];
This is also called a multi-dimensional array.

Exercise:
Create a nested array called myArray.

Tests:
Waiting:myArray should have at least one array nested within another array.

const myArray = [];
*/
const myArray = [[]];

console.log();
