/*
Explanation:
The /= operator divides a variable by another number.

myVar = myVar / 5;
Will divide myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar /= 5;

Exercise:
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the /= operator.

let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

a = a / 12;
b = b / 4;
c = c / 11;
*/
let a = 48;
let b = 108;
let c = 33;

a /= 12;
b /= 4;
c /= 11;

console.log(a + " " + b + " " + c);
