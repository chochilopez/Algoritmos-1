/*
Explanation:
The *= operator multiplies a variable by a number.

myVar = myVar * 5;
will multiply myVar by 5. This can be rewritten as:

myVar *= 5;

Exercise:
Convert the assignments for a, b, and c to use the *= operator.

let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a = a * 5;
b = 3 * b;
c = c * 10;
*/
let a = 5;
let b = 12;
let c = 4.6;

a *= 5;
b *= 3;
c *= 10;

console.log(a + " " + b + " " + c);
