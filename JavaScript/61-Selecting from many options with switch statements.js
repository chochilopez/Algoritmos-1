Explanation:
If you need to match one value against many options, you can use a switch statement. A switch statement compares the value to the case statements which define various possible values. Any valid JavaScript statements can be executed inside a case block and will run from the first matched case value until a break is encountered.

Here is an example of a switch statement:

switch (fruit) {
  case "apple":
    console.log("The fruit is an apple");
    break;
  case "orange":
    console.log("The fruit is an orange");
    break;
}
case values are tested with strict equality (===). The break tells JavaScript to stop executing statements. If the break is omitted, the next statement will be executed.

Exercise:
Write a switch statement which tests val and sets answer for the following conditions:
1 - alpha
2 - beta
3 - gamma
4 - delta

Tests:
Waiting:caseInSwitch(1) should have a value of the string alpha
Waiting:caseInSwitch(2) should have a value of the string beta
Waiting:caseInSwitch(3) should have a value of the string gamma
Waiting:caseInSwitch(4) should have a value of the string delta
Waiting:You should not use any if or else statements
Waiting:You should have at least 3 break statements

function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";
  // Only change code below this line



  // Only change code above this line
  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);
*/
function caseInSwitch(val) {
  let answer = "";

  return answer;
}

caseInSwitch(1);

console.log();
